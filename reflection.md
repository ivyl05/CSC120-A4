- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My initial impression of encapsulation is that it gives programmers control over what is visible to the public. This is crucial for protecting privacy in many cases. For example, when we enter our phone numbers on a website, we wouldnâ€™t want everyone to see them. By using an accessor method to retrieve private phone numbers, it is possible to display only the last few digits to the public. This ensures that our privacy is protected.

In my code, I set all the attributes in the classes to private and created public accessors for each attribute. This approach prevents direct access to the attributes from outside the class, providing greater protection for them.

The instructions for this assignment are very detailed, which is very helpful. My code compiled and ran successfully. It took me some time to understand where and how to use exceptions. I would suggest that future students pay close attention to the instructions.
